# How to add your information and your project details

> ℹ️ Merge/pull requests support for group members only at this time.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. After forking, make changes to the data files according on your repository.
    1. For better editing experience, open a Code session on the web by tapping `.` (period) while at the forked repository.
3. After committing and pushing the changes, you can create a Pull Request from your forked repository (e.g. `your-github/sac-homepage`) to the upstream repository (i.e. `sac-research/homepage`).
4. To create the PR, go to your repository and click on the `# commits ahead of sac-research:master` hyperlink.
5. After which, click on the <kbd>Create pull request</kbd> button.
6. A default PR template is generated for edit in Markdown.
7. After filling in the required description for the PRs, click the <kbd>Create pull request</kbd> to submit the PR.

## Member Details

Please add yourself in [/data/members](/data/members.js) following the group `Member` class object.

To add your record, append to the `members` array with a `createMember` function and fill in the object parameters, like this

```js
export const members = [
   createMember({
      honorific: `Mr.`,
      firstName: `A`,
      lastName: `Smith`,
      project: [`project 1`, `project 2`, ...],
      homepage: `https://example.com`
      ...
   })
]
```

**Note:** It is recommended that you use backticks for string literals.
